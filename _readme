0. preprocessing & dataAugmentation.py for preprocessing
1. training.py & hyperparameterTuning.py & robustnessTest.py for training models
2. networkAnalysis.py & hyperparameterOverview.py for visualization of performance results and modularity
3. taskRepresentation.py for analyzing models hidden structure
4. errorAnalysis.py & taskAccuracy.py for analyzing specific cognitive behavior

ToDo:
- Robustness test for highDim best model LeakyRNN all beRNNs
- Integrate LAB stuff
- Compare state variable models within participants (sleep quality, drug consumption)
- Create semantic error classes inspired by literature
- Compare successful hyperaparaemter sets overlap between subjects
- Optuna optimization
- Clone participants
- Set up probabilistic model (RNN)
- Comparison to brain networks (RSA)
- check MS code for suspect results
- Visualize reasoning over time in models (poc)
- Visualize everything better

Train:
- hpOverview: highDim beRNN_03 w. all models
- hpOverview: highDim beRNN_04 216 models shown only?
- hpOverview: 3stimTC beRNN_04 w. all models
- hpOverview: CorrOnly beRNN_01 w. all models
